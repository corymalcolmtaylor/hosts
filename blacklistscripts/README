These scripts help you add your own blocked urls.
usage:
//used from the folder containing the script eg /Users/myname/Dev/hosts/blacklistscripts
./fhosts.sh http://somebadurl.com/?ochaoeijfsdvmsijglbrs=fsv;lendr&c;lknr;ogr=s;lvnzer8h

The script will copy the new hosts file to /etc/hosts and restart your network
connection and therefore the the script uses sudo so you will need to enter
your password while it runs.
On linux it uses nmcli and takes the last uuid entry to be your preferred
connection as that happens to be mine.

If you use the chrome extension "link redirect trace" you can copy its trace
to the clipboard and then paste the whole thing into the temp.urls file
 - overwriting all that file's previous contents - and then use the ./b.sh script
which calls the fhostsbatch.awk script to batch process the
urls and then calls fhosts.sh  to copy the results and then recreates the temp.urls file.

These scripts do not use the python scripts.  Perhaps as an added feature they will
someday add the new urls to the ../blacklist file.
